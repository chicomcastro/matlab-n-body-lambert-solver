# n-body-matlab

Matlab routines for simulate and analyse N-body Problem on celestial 
dinamics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem).


Codes' original author is James Mireles. Got them from:
http://cosweb1.fau.edu/~jmirelesjames/notes.html


I had adapt Mireles codes to accept more user friendly inputs and had organize
files to increment legibility.

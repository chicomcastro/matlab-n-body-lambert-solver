# n-body-lambert-solver

Matlab routines for simulate and analyse N-body Problem on celestial 
dinamics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem).


Based on codes from James Mireles. Got them from:
http://cosweb1.fau.edu/~jmirelesjames/notes.html


I had adapt Mireles codes to accept more user friendly inputs and had organize
files to increment legibility.


I've also implemented shootingMethod.m routine from Schaub & Junkins literature
(Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems, 2003, AIAA, Ver 12.3.1). 
Planning to develop some optimization methods to test 3 body patched conics
and best convergence velocity.
